Google Test
===========
Google Test is a C++ testing suite.
I find it very well designed and it is my preferred way to test C/C++ code.  
Take a look at the [project home page](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).  
If you need help setting it up or creating test programs,
take a look at the [Google Test Example repository](https://github.com/taylormck/GoogleTestExample).
