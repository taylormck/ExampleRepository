Example Repository
==================
<!-- TODO intro and Team Collaboration -->
This repository, as its name implies,
is a simple repository created to show off a handful of Github's features
and several of the tools that integrate with it.
As a start, the features and tools presented in
[Team Collaboration with Github](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/team-collaboration-with-github/)
will put to use.

I'll try to make sure that there are clear instructions explaining how to use
all the tools associated with this repo.
If you find anything to be unclear, open up an issue and I'll get around to clearing it up.

If you know a cool new tool or feature that I'm not using,
feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
